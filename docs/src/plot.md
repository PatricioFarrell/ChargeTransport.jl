 
# Plotting Routines
The same design as in VoronoiFVM.jl is used: To avoid dependencies for this package,
the plot methods defined in this package have as their first argument the module of
the plotting package used.

Currently, only PyPlot was tested.

## API for Plotting methods
```@autodocs
Modules = [ChargeTransportInSolids]
Pages = ["ct_plotting.jl"]
Order = [:function]
```
