Mathematical drift-diffusion models
================================
`ChargeTransport.jl` relies on the drift-diffusion semiconductor equations which are sometimes
referred to as van Roosbroeck system. This nonlinear system of partial differential equations 
couples Poisson's equation to several continuity equations. The precise type and amount will vary with the specific application. 

In this section, we would like to 
describe the mathematical theory a bit more in detail. We denote with $\alpha$ with the charge 
carrier, with $n_\alpha$ its corresponding density in a device region $\mathbf{\Omega}$ during a 
finite time interval $[0, t_F]$. 

## Poisson's equation

Poisson's equation for the electric potential $\psi$ is given by
```math
\begin{aligned}
- \nabla \cdot \Bigl(\varepsilon_s \nabla \psi(\mathbf{x}, t) \Bigr) &= q \sum_{\alpha} z_\alpha \Bigl( n_\alpha(\mathbf{x}, t) - C_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) \Bigr).
\end{aligned}
```
Here, 
$\varepsilon_s$
denotes the dielectric permittivity and $ q $ the elementary charge. The right-hand side of Poisson's equation, the space charge density, is the sum of charge carrier densities
$n_\alpha$
multiplied by their respective charge numbers 
$z_\alpha$
and some corresponding fixed charges, the doping $ C_\alpha $.

## Continuity equations

Poisson's equation is coupled to additional continuity equations for each charge carrier $\alpha$, which describe the motion of free charge carriers in an electric field
```math
\begin{aligned}
z_\alpha q \partial_t n_\alpha +  \nabla\cdot \mathbf{j}_\alpha 
	&= 
	z_\alpha q	r_\alpha.
\end{aligned}
```
Here, the flux
$\mathbf{j}_\alpha$
refers to the the carrier's current density and $r_\alpha$ for some production/reduction rates.
These rates may be chosen to represent different recombination or generation models such as Shockley-Read-Hall, Auger or direct recombination. Further details on which recombination or generation models are implemented can be found in [the general description of the code](@ref generalDescription).

The amount and type of charge carriers will dependent on the specific application. The standard semiconductor equations use electrons $\alpha=n$ and holes $\alpha=p$.

## Drift-diffusion fluxes
Our code uses as independent variables the electrostatic potential $\psi$ as well as the quasi Fermi
potentials $\varphi_\alpha$. The charge carrier densities $n_\alpha$ are linked to the corresponding quasi Fermi potentials via the state equations 
```math
\begin{aligned}
n_\alpha = N_\alpha \mathcal{F}_\alpha \Bigl(\eta_\alpha(\psi, \varphi_\alpha) \Bigr), \quad \eta_\alpha = z_\alpha \frac{q (\varphi_\alpha - \psi) + E_\alpha}{k_B T},
\end{aligned}
```
where the physical quantities are defined in the list at the very end. With this definition we can formulate the carrier current given by
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{j}_\alpha 
	=
    - (z_\alpha)^2 q \mu_\alpha  
    n_\alpha  
    \nabla\varphi_\alpha
    ~
\end{aligned}
```
with the negative gradients of the quasi Fermi potentials as driving forces. Using the state equations one may rewrite these fluxes in a drift-diffusion form.

!!! note

    The unknowns in `ChargeTransport.jl` are always defined as the quasi Fermi potentials $ \varphi_a$ and the electric potential $\psi$.
