`ChargeTransport.jl` simulates charge transport in semiconductors. To this end, it discretizes 
the semiconductor drift-diffusion equations via the Voronoi finite volume method as implemented in [VoronoiFVM.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/VoronoiFVM.jl).

### Special features 

- heterostructures
- 1D, 2D and 3D simulations 
- stationary and transient simulations
- IV curves and scan protocols
- an arbitrary amount of charge carriers may be added 
- thermodynamically consistent, physics preserving numerical methods
- different charge carrier statistics per species (Boltzmann, Blakemore, Fermi-Dirac, Gauss-Fermi)

Installation and first steps
================================
The installation can easily be done via the Julia REPL with the following commands

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("ChargeTransport")
```


The following packages need to be loaded

```julia
julia> using ChargeTransport 
julia> using VoronoiFVM      # nonlinear PDE solver 
julia> using ExtendableGrids # grid package
```
We recommend to have a look at the example files:

```@contents
Pages = [
    "GaAs.md",
    "PSC.md",
    ]
Depth = 2
```

You can load an example as follows

```julia
julia> include("Example103_PSC.jl")
julia> Example103_PSC.main()                
julia> Example103_PSC.main(plotting = true) # show plots 
```
Since the examples are encapsulated into modules, you can load as many examples as you wish. If you would like to modify one of the examples, consider using [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) and `includet`.
